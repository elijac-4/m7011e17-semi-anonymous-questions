## Description
m7011e17-semi-anonymous-questions created by GitHub Classroom

Our project aspire to follow the proposed idea of semi-anonymous questions.

In order to alleviate uncertainty from lectures students will be free to ask anonymous questions. In terms, these questions will populate a board where they can be voted upon to emphasis importance, and students can anonymously answer questions to help their peers. The teacher can also use this platform to decide upon questions to answer in following lectures.

If students abuse the webpage then designated teacher users can decide to either warn or directly block the anonymous account. The teacher create the accounts for the student-circle, so students who are locked out can't re-enter the circle without teacher authentication.
